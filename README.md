# Libertinus Font Family

----

## NOTICE!

This is a legacy branch that contains all the original commits as originally released by [Alif Type](https://alif-type.github.io/). All of the v6.x tags seen on the [Releases](https://github.com/alerque/libertinus/releases) page are also 100% original.

Please see the [new default branch](https://github.com/alerque/libertinus) for current project status. Note the new branch has been filtered to remove all of the binary OTF, WOFF, and WOFF2 files found in the orginal history, bringing the size of a Git clone down from ~300Mb to ~30Mb. If you do clone the repository and want only the new branch, consider using `git clone --single-branch`.

For the exact state of the repository when it was passed off, browse the state at commit [85d8ed1](https://github.com/alerque/libertinus/tree/85d8ed1d36d45b2e5ef7201f9d5e7740c1eddb7c).
