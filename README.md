Libertine fonts
===============

Libertine fonts is a fork of the Linux Libertine and Linux Biolinum fonts that
started as an OpenType math companion of the Libertine font family, but grown
as a full forl to address some of the bugs in the fonts.

The family consists of:

* Libertine Serif: formerly _Linux Libertine_.
* Libertine Sans: formerly _Linux Biolinum_.
* Libertine Mono: formerly _Linux Libertine Mono_.
* Libertine Math: an OpenType math font for use in OpenType math-capable
  applications like LuaTeX, XeTeX or MS Word 2007+.

  Libertine Math is in its the early development stages, and there arenâ€™t any
  releases yet.

Libertine fonts are available under the terms of Open Font License version 1.1.
