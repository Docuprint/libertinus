## History

The Libertinus fonts project began as a fork of the [Linux Libertine][1] and Linux Biolinum fonts.
The original impetus was to add an OpenType math companion to the Libertine font family.
Over time it grew into to a full-fledged fork addressing many of the bugs in the Libertine fonts.

Libertinus was forked from the [5.3.0 (2012-07-02) release][2] of Linux Libertine fonts.
Thanks to Frédéric Wang for coming up with the name Libertinus.

Thanks Khaled Hosny who was the primary contributor and maintainer from 2012–2020.
If you like this font consider sponsoring him.

In 2020, Khaled passed the role of maintainer on to Caleb Maclennan.
