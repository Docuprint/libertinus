FONTLOG for Libertine
---------------------

This file provides detailed information on the Libertine font software. This
information should be distributed along with the Libertine fonts and any
derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Libertine fonts is a fork of the Linux Libertine and Linux Biolinum fonts that
started as an OpenType math companion of the Libertine font family, but grown
as a full fork to address some of the bugs in the fonts.

The family consists of:

* Libertine Serif: forked from *Linux Libertine*.
* Libertine Sans: forked from *Linux Biolinum*.
* Libertine Mono: forked from *Linux Libertine Mono*.
* Libertine Math: an OpenType math font for use in OpenType math-capable
  applications like LuaTeX, XeTeX or MS Word 2007+.

Libertine development is currently hosted on:

ChangeLog
---------

18 Jan 2016 (Khaled Hosny) <Libertine> Version 6.0.0
First release of the forked Libertine fonts, changes since the fork include:
- New Libertine Math font.
- Dropped the use of Unicode PUA for alternate glyphs in favour of making them
  encoded. 
- Dropped the TrueType versions of the fonts.
- Dropped the Romanian-specific cedilla/comma substitution, it is no longer
  recommended to do this at font feature level.
- Fixed upstream font kerning regression.
- Renamed the glyphs to follow the recommended Adobe Glyph Names for New Fonts.
- Fixed lots of inconsistencies in the font files.
- Fixed the encoding of Indian Rubee symbol.
- Made the sans question mark a bit more sans-like.
- Fixed sans interrobang to not use the serif glyphs.
- Removed some bogus ligatures like “!!”, “??”, “...”, etc.
- Fixed the “short f” feature.
- Made the “bunny ears” glyphs with dieresis the alternate form, and made the
  more conventional form the default.
- Dropped the “aalt” feature, since it is of limited use and hard to keep up to
  date.
- Fixed diaeresis positioning in bold serif.
- Fixed the following upstream bugs:
